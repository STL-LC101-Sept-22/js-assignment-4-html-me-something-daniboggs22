      My absolute favorite thing to make is hair bows.Whether you need them for
      your kids, your family members, a special event, or just need it for
      yourself, I got you! I make bows for holidays, seasonal, beauty pageants,
      birthdays, and every other day of the year!

    <h4>Animal Bows</h4>
    <p>
      Do you have a fur baby? I make bows for them too! I make bows to go on the
      collars of your favorite furry companions! I bet you're probably wondering
      if I can personalize the bow with their name... the answer is YES!

      asking for a custom order!

      <h4>About Me</h4>
        I began making bows for my two adorable girls. It turns out, I had so
        much fun making them, I made too many for them to even be able to wear!
        I decided to reach out to my friends and see who may be interested in
        purchasing bows (and funding my new found hobby!). I started making bows
        for my friends, and then their friends! After that I branched out and
        started making all sorts of fun&nbsp;things!
