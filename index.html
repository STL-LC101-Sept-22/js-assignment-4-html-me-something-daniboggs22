      My absolute favorite thing to make is hair bows.Whether you need them for
      your kids, your family members, a special event, or just need it for
      yourself, I got you! I make bows for holidays, seasonal, beauty pageants,
      birthdays, and every other day of the year!

  <h4>Animal Bows</h4>
    <p>
      Do you have a fur baby? I make bows for them too! I make bows to go on the
      collars of your favorite furry companions! I bet you're probably wondering
      if I can personalize the bow with their name... the answer is YES!

      Need an item that you just can't find online? Or maybe you've found
      something, but want something slightly different? Chances are, I can help!
      Some custom orders I have made include: Specific style or character bows,
      Beauty Pageant bows, shirts, Bow holders, Cheerleading style bows,
      personalized bookmarks, personalized lanyards... the list goes on and on!

      I have learned how to make so many different things because of customers
      asking for a custom order!

      <h4>About Me</h4>
        I began making bows for my two adorable girls. It turns out, I had so
        much fun making them, I made too many for them to even be able to wear!
        I decided to reach out to my friends and see who may be interested in
        purchasing bows (and funding my new found hobby!). I started making bows
        for my friends, and then their friends! After that I branched out and
        started making all sorts of fun&nbsp;things!
